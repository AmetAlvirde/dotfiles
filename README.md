AmetAlvirdeâ€™s Dotfiles
=================

Here is what I use every day:

- Arch linux with gnome 3.
- Terminator as terminal emulator.
- Zsh (with oh-my-zsh) shell.
- Tmux as terminal multiplexor.
- NeoVim as my default text editor. 
- Emacs, for orgmode, time-tracking and fincancial management.

These dotfiles have a friendly description so you may understand it better.
I do not recommend to clone it and simply use it, but to start your own
from scratch, and study these as a guide for getting where you want.

This README should get better at some point soon. but the files in here
are well documented.

If you have any questions or suggestions I'm happy to chat on Twitter:
