AmetAlvirde’s Dotfiles
=================

Time has come in which I’m mature enough to recognize the incredible advantages
of mantaining a Dotfiles project and being a more responsible (and sophisticated)
sworn member of the developers community.

So before the old gods, the new ones, the red, the one that I believe in, and
you, my beloved community, I present with nothing but my roaring desire to help
every dev brother that shall cross my path, my Dotfiles.

Initially there are just my ~/.tmux.conf, ~/.tmuxinator tempaltes, and my
~/.init.el which fires up my ~/.emacs-init.org configuration file which is,
of course, written with org-mode, because let’s face it: that’s elegant and
awesome as fuck.

I also use zsh and vim like HARDCORE. But I decided to declare bankrupcy with
both of them, since I’m guilty as charged for the inappropriate use of config
dotfile frameworks that does much more than I imagine they do, and that I have
slain with non-intrusive, but also devastating non-ducumented changes into its
very source. Hence, here I am. Releaving myself from such horrors and trying
to do some good to the society by sharing my dotfiles as an Open Source project.

For the web is grandious, and full of hackers.

Yours, truly:
Lord Amet. The polymath, from House Render.
